# Vector

**Autonomous Product Strategy Engine** — upload your customer data, run an AI analysis, and get a prioritized build recommendation backed by revenue impact and market evidence.

---

## What it does

Vector ingests three data sources — churned customer records, support tickets, and feature adoption metrics — and runs a multi-step AI pipeline to answer: *what should we build next, and why?*

1. **Extracts themes** from churn reasons, ticket text, and usage gaps, weighted by ARR
2. **Computes revenue exposure** — how much ARR is at risk, and how much could be recovered
3. **Researches market evidence** — real examples of how other B2B SaaS companies handled the same decision
4. **Generates an engineering spec** — schema changes, API endpoints, UI updates, and a full task graph ready to hand to engineers

Results are shown in a live war-room dashboard with three panels: signal feed, strategic core (analysis + spec), and revenue exposure model.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Backend / DB | [Convex](https://convex.dev) (reactive database + serverless actions) |
| LLM | [MiniMax](https://api.minimax.io) via Anthropic-compatible API (`MiniMax-M2.5`) |
| Market research | [rtrvr.ai](https://rtrvr.ai) (web agent for sourcing real-world evidence) |
| UI components | shadcn/ui, Radix UI |

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Convex](https://dashboard.convex.dev) account
- A MiniMax API key
- A rtrvr.ai API key (optional — fallback seed data is included)

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Initialize Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will prompt you to log in and create a new Convex project. It starts the local dev backend and generates the `convex/_generated/` types.

### 3. Set environment variables

In the Convex dashboard (or via `npx convex env set`), add:

```
MINIMAX_API_KEY=your_minimax_api_key
RTRVR_API_KEY=your_rtrvr_api_key
```

Create `frontend/.env.local` with your Convex deployment URL (auto-generated by `npx convex dev`):

```
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_slug
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
```

### 4. Seed market evidence

Pre-populate the fallback evidence cards (used when rtrvr.ai hasn't been run):

```bash
npx convex run seed:seedMarketEvidence
```

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Using the app

### Upload data

On first load you'll see the data upload screen. Drop three CSV files:

| File | Required columns |
|---|---|
| `customers.csv` | `company`, `segment` (Enterprise/SMB), `arr`, `churned` (true/false), `churn_reason` |
| `tickets.csv` | `arr`, `issue` |
| `usage.csv` | `feature`, `enterprise_adoption` (%), `smb_adoption` (%) |

Click **Load Data** to ingest. The war room appears automatically once data is loaded.

### Run analysis

Click **Run Analysis** in the center panel. The pipeline takes ~60–90 seconds and streams progress live via the ASCII animation. When complete, the dashboard shows:

- **Recommendation** — what to stop building and what to build next
- **Themes** — ranked by ARR-weighted enterprise signal
- **Market evidence** — real-world examples from comparable companies
- **Engineering spec** — schema, API endpoints, UI changes, and task graph

### Adjust revenue assumptions

Use the **Recovery Assumption** selector in the right panel (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive) to model different retention scenarios. Numbers update instantly.

## Demo reset

To wipe all data and return to the upload screen:

```bash
./reset.sh
```

This clears all customer, ticket, usage, and analysis data, then re-seeds the market evidence fallback. Run it from the repo root.

You can also upload new data at any time without resetting — click the **↑ Upload data** button in the navbar.

## Refreshing market evidence

Market evidence is pre-seeded with fallback data. To pull fresh results from rtrvr.ai for a specific theme (run once before a demo):

```bash
npx convex run analysis:refreshEvidence '{"topTheme":"Enterprise SSO"}'
```

Replace `"Enterprise SSO"` with whatever theme your data surfaces.
